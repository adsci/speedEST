# Performance summary

The performance of the developed machine learning models is summarised in the table below, where the mean absolute error (MAE, in km/h) is reported for the training, validation and test sets, respectively. 
In addition, the $R^2$ score of the model on the test set is given.

For completeness, the histograms and probability distributions of the residuals (differences between the true and predicted values) in the test set are presetented below for both models.
